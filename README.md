# BadUSB-apple-blee-ble_read_state.py
Using hexways apple_blee found here: https://github.com/hexway/apple_bleee  

I used Rubber Ducky 1.0 to automate the installation and automatically start BLE read state.
I want to reiterate that I did not make any of the scripts besides the the Ducky BadUSB script for automation of the installation, I tested in using a Flipper Zero and Kali Linux running on a Rasberry PI 5.

If you want to customize the script to run on another Linux Distrobution you would want to change the second (STRING qterminal) to what ever terminal your linux distrobution uses for example (STRING Gnome_Terminal) 

The Rubber Ducky script is inside of the .txt file

this is just for educational purposes and I wanted to play around with Rubber Ducky 1.0 on my Flipper Zero.

again the actual code was written by hexway: https://github.com/hexway/apple_bleee

I just automated the installation process
