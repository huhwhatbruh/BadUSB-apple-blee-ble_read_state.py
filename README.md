# BadUSB-apple-blee-ble_read_state.py
Using hexways apple_blee found here: https://github.com/hexway/apple_bleee   I used Rubber Ducky 1.0 to automate the installation and automatically start BLE read state.  I want to reiterate that I did not make any of the scripts besides the the Ducky BadUSB script for automation of the installation, I tested in using a Flipper Zero and Kali Linux
